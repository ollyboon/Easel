                           Since I was studying in high school, I always like to work with programs by computers. I only enjoyed my classes which it was based on computers. So I decided to choose a program that allow me to do the job that I like. I was going to study Animation but unfortunately I'm not good at the paintings,so I couldn't be good at it. Then I decided to study Digital Media Design. Because DMD is similar to animation, and also its based on computers and technologies.

                            When choosing what course I will do at University, I was instantly dawn in to this choice from just the course name. After reading up on the course and how it offers a range of areas within, it wasn't hard for me to make my first choice. From doing Fine Art and Information Technology at A-Level, it was defiant that I would being doing a design course based on computers, which this course is. I still very happy with my choice of university and course, and seeing what the future bring in Digital Media Design.

                            My choice to study digital media spawned from my passion for design, with the course offering me the opportunity to further my interest, and potentially open doors to future job opportunities. Enhancing my creative ability, through the prospect of using web tools and programmes such as; PhotoShop, illustrator and brackets, was a key factor, which enthused me to instigate a digital media degree.

                           Being interested and a keen learner in computers and all things to do with technology, I wanted to a course that I would enjoy yet would challenge me. When I saw this course opportunity for Digital Media Design I knew that this would be a course that would tick both of those boxes. Even after a couple of terms doing the course I saw myself continuing in a future career within this area.               </p>
